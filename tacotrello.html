      <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi Trello!</h1>
      <h2>Your questions about the difference between good design and a good experience got me thinking, and I'm sharing my answers and thoughts. Here's my <a href="index.html">main site</a> with portfolio samples.</h2>

        <h2>I think Spotify (the desktop version specifically) has great visual design, but the experience could be much better.</h2>
        <p>As a music lover Spotify is great, and it certainly looks good with eye catching photos, bold typography, and lovely custom icons. There are some puzzling choices made in the interaction design that I think could be improved. Arguably they're targeting a very simple straightforward listening style, but as someone looking for more it's frustrating.</p>
        <h2>Confusing and Redundant Navigation Choices</h2>
        <img class="spotify-nav-image" src="{{base}}/assets/images/trello/spotify-nav.jpg">
        <p>The main navigation is where we start to see some issues. There are delineations between <em>Playlists</em>,<em>Your Library</em>, and the primary unlabeled section. <em>Browse</em> is an action verb, while <em>Radio</em> is not; a small point of concern. Furthermore we also see <em>Stations</em>, which seems at least related to <em>Radio</em> right?</p>
        <p>There's also a strong distinction being made between things that are "mine" vs available/streamable music which I'm not convinced is particularly useful to have. I can browse music by genre (which are actually playlists other people make) but not my own library.</p>
        <p>We can also use discovery features to find new music, which is different but largely related to <em>Your Daily Mix</em> (a collection of auto generated playlists). An interest experiment would be to simplify the interaction models here and keep these sorts of distinctions hidden from users. Mobile versions avoid much of this entirely, and it works better although at the expense of some capabilities.</p>
        <h2>Like and Add As Separate Functions</h2>
        <p>If I hear a song I like or don't, I can select a thumbs-up...sometimes. If I'm in a radio station it will (in theory) save that preference to improve what the station plays. I can also skip a song I don't like, which does the same thing as a thumbs down (I think). If I'm playing from a playlist I can't choose thumb-up or down though, but I can <em>Add</em> with a plus sign. This saves the song to my library, the benefit of which is not entirely clear at first. In the UI where a current song is playing, there's also a heart icon too! Encountering a different pattern to like or dislike a song or artist based on context is confusing. I think it would make the product stronger to see a more simplified consistent approach here.</p>
        <h2>Lack of Depth and Discovery Tools</h2>
        <img class="spotify-detail-image" src="{{base}}/assets/images/trello/spotify-detail.jpg">
        <p>Let's say you hear a song with a great guitar solo. You look to see who it is and you'll get the singer or main artist, but if you realize you don't know who the guitar player is you're out of luck. Digging deep gets you some weak text only details (see reference above).</p>
        <p>You can try associated artists, or see similar playlists, but if it's a session musician with a pop artist, or a jazz record, or a hip hop sample or anything where the song artist isn't just a singular band, you have no way to find this. You're left with doing a browser search, finding separate databases, Wikipedia, and sourcing liner notes to get what you're looking for. Hyperlinking artists and performers would encourage a much deeper experience and relationship with music.</p>

        <h2>A contrasting experience is US Audio Mart, a site for buying and selling music gear.</h2>
        <p>It looks awful, is cluttered with little used features, and outdated in many ways, but the core experiences are all very easy to use. Attention has been paid to the features most useful to buyers and sellers, and it shows.</p>
        <img class="audiomart-image" src="{{base}}/assets/images/trello/audiomart-main.jpg">
        <h2>Simple Browsing of Listings</h2>
        <p>The main purpose of the site is to help people buy and sell used music and stereo gear. eBay is too full of junk listings and has crazy  high fees, especially for expensive items. To that end, little things like the browse view (while again, terribly ugly and cluttered) are surpisingly well done. A typical user is browsing for specific brand, so having a condensed display (as opposed to a grid with thumbnails or similar) allows for fast browsing. Location/state is also useful, as private shipping can be crazy for heavy equipment. The distinction between dealers and private users helps people interested in a specific type of seller too.</p>

        <h2>Clarity of Details</h2>
        <p>Once you've identified the item you're interested in, the detail view is another solid setup that works very well despite aesthetic issues and extraneous junk at the margins (ads, little used features, etc). Seeing an items current asking prive vs original MSRP helps you see if you're getting a good value. The weight and size are useful for shipping estimates, and there are solid sections about the seller, helping to inspire trust.</p>
        <p>Replying to the ad is simple and clear with a button, and images work just how you'd expect them to as well. The patterns certainly aren't unique or innovative, but they use established conventions to help users work quickly and reward them with a simple experience.</p>
