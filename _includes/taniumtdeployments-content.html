    <h2>The challenge</h2>
    <p>Tanium excels at capturing and working with real-time data, but the console interface to actually use the software was a menagerie mostly unconnected views. I was given the broad task of figuring out a way to provide insight into what is currently happening in the customer's environment.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>The concept</h2>
    <p>After talking with a number of subject matter experts and customers, I identified a few key themes:
      <ul>
        <li>Users wanted aggregate data - many environments manage > 100,000 endpoints, so displaying any individual endpoint data would be way too noisy to be useful.</li>
        <li>Rather than <em>all</em> data, users were interested in a handful of highly impactful tasks, like machines performing scans, software updates being installed, etc.</li>
        <li>Two distinct experiences were needed; one for a quick glance at the data, and another for more detail, as part of an investigative workflow for example.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Prioritization and Design</h2>
    <p>We decided to focus on two broad areas of data: deployments (things being pushed to happen on machines), and scans (a requisite step for visibility and compliance with these machines).</p>
    <p>Deployments have a number of possible statuses, represented by colors in the bars (with tooltip labels as well). This matches existing module functionality, so it was easy for users to identify what they were seeing.</p>
    <p>With scans, the important piece of data is more binary; simply knowing if a machine was performing a given scan or not. With that in mind I used a single color to represent scan activity, which also helps differentiate that tab from deployments.</p>

    <p>For non-standard UI pieces, I leveraged paper prototypes to quickly test ideas and explore layout options.</p>

    <h2>Progressive Detail</h2>
    <p>One theme I pushed here was offering levels of detail for users to access:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A persistent small icon representing simply which endpoints in an environment are doing "something". If a user performs an action they think should result in heavy activity but they don't see that reflected, they know they need to dig deeper.</li>
      <li>A side panel that has aggregate data at the top of the panel. Again this allows for a quick judgment for a user to say "this looks okay to me" or "I need to learn more".</li>
      <li>More context further down in the panels. Breaking apart the data by product module or activity allows for a more specific understanding of what's happening.</li>
      <li>New page views for the most detail. If a user needs to really dig in to the data, I added links to very detailed page views which mirror the structure of the panel but with a greater level of detail.</li>
    </ul>

      <p>I led the team that conducted evaluative research with a variety of customers for this project.</p>

    <h2>Planning and testing</h2>
    <p>Building a MVP meant that we didn't have an actual user group to test or solicit feedback from. We leveraged a small group of testers to quickly evaluate prototypes and ideas. I also employed simulated eye-tracking on major views to ensure the layouts were focusing on the right things.</p>

    <h2>What I learned</h2>
    <p>Working with a large team spread across multiple regions, languages, and timezones was challenging. There were times when I had to work in an inefficient way to better fit another team's requirements, and I always had to balance the volume of feedback with my own experience and the stated priorities.</p>

    <p>Documentation was key every step of the way, and I created various diagrams and flow charts to keep everyone on the same page.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>MVP product launched within original timeframe goals. The application worked well for a lengthy sales cycle, eventually being by acquired Azuga who is currently representing it as an option for independent insurance agencies.</p>
