    <h2>What are we building?<br>How long is it going to take? <br>How much is it going to cost?</h2>
    <P>These are questions software development lifecycle (SDLC) leaders struggle to answer. Bloomfilter uses process mining, AI, and real data from product and engineering tools to paint a clear picture of the actual processes and helps teams understand how to reduce waste.</p>

      <p>When I started with Bloomfilter the platform was essentially a proof of concept. The general idea resonated with early customers but UX had not been a priority and there were no design standards in place.</p>
      <p>We needed to understand where we should go next.</p>

    <h2>Strategic Priorities</h2>
    <p>One thing users repeatedly asked for was an ability to define high level plans and goals, so that the granular data Bloomfilter presented could be tied back to those for tracking, performance reviews, and resource planning.</p>
    <p>The scope was kept narrow and focused with the understanding further integrations and enhancements would add more capability over time. What was the most basic unit we could ask a user to define? What was the most impactful data they would see right away?</p>

    <h2>A View into Financials</h2>
    <p>A key challenge I heard was how to bridge the gap between engineering deliverables and intervals (cards, points, sprints, etc) and those used by the organization at large (dollars, quarters, etc).</p>
    <p>I designed a flow based on division, where users enter in either budgeted or total spend amounts and calculations can be made based on that. Typical models were multiplication based, using average rates for employees and other metrics which were often problematic and inaccurate. The general solution was a multi-axis graph of arbitrary time series data. Although it felt complex to me it was very well received in testing, offering a flexible and insightful view.</p>

    <h2>Design System</h2>
    <p>While building out these features, I worked closely with our engineering team to begin defining and implementing a basic design system. I started very tactically, cleaning up and presenting a color palette, basic text styling, and common UI controls like buttons. I took care to document the <em>why?</em> for decisions to support growth and expansion.</p>
    <p>We set up a Storybook instance and began to tie in common settings and values as design tokens.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>These features and the design system are helping Bloomfilter launch their platform.</p>
    <h3>Increase in time users spent on platform: ~20%</h3>
    <p>Demos were done at several conferences focused on these features and prototypes I built, leading to dozens of new leads for the sales pipeline.</p>
