    <h2>The challenge</h2>
    <p>The Tanium platform is built with operators (who are typically experts in some area of IT) in mind. There's tremendous value for management and higher level stakeholders, but granting them access to a standard environment is not a viable solution.</p>

    <h2>The concept</h2>
    <p>On my own time, I began to create the concept of a simplified, largely read-only view of the existing data Tanium has in an environment.</p>
    <p>Instead of deep dives on data, comprehensive views and action-oriented workflows, this worked on high-level, plain language questions and easy to digest results. The goal would be to highlight the power of what was already in a user's environment, but not in a format that would resonate with a typical executive.</p>

    <h2>Reaction and Iteration</h2>
    <p>I presented my concepts to several executives. Overall the feedback was very positive "puts a refreshingly human face..."</p>
    <p>I incorporated feedback around what data to present and how we could structure the experience.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Despite good feedback and interest, the idea hasn't yet had the engineering resources to make it a reality. One aspect of the design, human curated text to accompany data visualizations was prioritized though, and was implemented to the existing Taniunm console.</p>
