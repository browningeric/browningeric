    <h2>The challenge</h2>
    <p>Patch and Deploy are two of the most widely used (>30m endpoints managed) IT Operations products at Tanium. I was tasked with ownership of their user experience. This led to a number of significant features, improvements, and activities over several years. A few examples of that work are highlighted here.</p>

    <h2>Early Work: Understanding and Guidance</h2>
    <p>Early on in my engagement, I was able to co-lead a workshop with engineering and product leadership.</p>
    <p>We wanted to answer the question of why some of our automation features were not seeing much usage.</p>

    <h2>A Readiness Widget</h2>
    <p>With understanding from our research and input from ***** I prototyped a design for a recurring display of readiness to do OS Patching. We knew a true "easy button" scared users, but helping them understand exactly what was going to happen and why with their regular patch cadence would be a huge benefit.</p>

    <h2>Progressive Detail</h2>
    <p>One theme I pushed here was offering levels of detail for users to access:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A persistent small icon representing simply which endpoints in an environment are doing "something". If a user performs an action they think should result in heavy activity but they don't see that reflected, they know they need to dig deeper.</li>
      <li>A side panel that has aggregate data at the top of the panel. Again this allows for a quick judgment for a user to say "this looks okay to me" or "I need to learn more".</li>
      <li>More context further down in the panels. Breaking apart the data by product module or activity allows for a more specific understanding of what's happening.</li>
      <li>New page views for the most detail. If a user needs to really dig in to the data, I added links to very detailed page views which mirror the structure of the panel but with a greater level of detail.</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>I led the team that conducted evaluative research with a variety of customers for this project.</p>

    <h2>Planning and testing</h2>
    <p>Building a MVP meant that we didn't have an actual user group to test or solicit feedback from. We leveraged a small group of testers to quickly evaluate prototypes and ideas. I also employed simulated eye-tracking on major views to ensure the layouts were focusing on the right things.</p>

    <h2>What I learned</h2>
    <p>Working with a large team spread across multiple regions, languages, and timezones was challenging. There were times when I had to work in an inefficient way to better fit another team's requirements, and I always had to balance the volume of feedback with my own experience and the stated priorities.</p>

    <p>Documentation was key every step of the way, and I created various diagrams and flow charts to keep everyone on the same page.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>MVP product launched within original timeframe goals. The application worked well for a lengthy sales cycle, eventually being by acquired Azuga who is currently representing it as an option for independent insurance agencies.</p>
