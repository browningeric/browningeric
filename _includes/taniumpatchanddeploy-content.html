    <h2>The challenge</h2>
    <p>Patch and Deploy are two of the most widely used (>30m endpoints managed) IT Operations products at Tanium. I was tasked with ownership of their user experience. This led to a number of significant features, improvements, and activities over several years. A few examples of that work are highlighted here.</p>

    <h2>Early Work: Understanding and Guidance</h2>
    <p>Early on in my engagement, I was able to co-lead a research effort with engineering and product leadership.</p>
    <p>We wanted to answer the question of why some of our automation features were not seeing much usage. User research sessions were held to understand the mental models and workflows of new and veteran users.</p>
    <p>Our cross functional team workshopped to analyze the data and understand the stories that were emerging.</p>
    <p><strong>What did we learn?</strong> A number of things, but one of the biggest was that automation is scary to IT Ops professionals. The complexities of their environments and the stakes involved meant that they were unlikely to adopt much automation, no matter how well we built it.</p>

    <h2>A Readiness Widget</h2>
    <p>With understanding from our research and input from our customer success group I prototyped a design for a recurring display of readiness to perform OS Patching. We had learned that a true "easy button" scared users, but helping them understand exactly what was going to happen and why with their regular patch cadence would be a huge benefit.</p>
    <p>OS Patches are released on a regular cadence. When this occurs, operators want to know which machines are ready to be updated, which do not meet some prequalifications, and tooling issues or anything else that may lead to unexpected results.</p>

    </a>
    <p>This data already existed in the platform, but requried users to have the knowledge to know where to look and the planning to seek out everything on time. Offering all the relevant data in a simple obvious display was great step forward. Each category can be expanded, to view more details about potential issues and begin remediation.</p>

      <h2>End User Self Service</h2>
      <p>I lead a project to build, and later redesign an end-user self service application. Historically an administrator of Tanium would deploy software to user's machines to install new tools, update to new versions, etc.</p>
      <p>What we built was an application where admins would select software, build rules around restrictions and scheduling but end users themselves would be able to choose what software to install or update and when on their machines.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <p>End User Self Service (EUSS) was launched as an MVP product with a simple design language. Over time, I gathered customer and stakeholder feedback which pointed to a need for expanded functionality and an updated design. I created a more modern and full featured experience for the second version of EUSS, which is in wide use today.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>I worked on a number of different additional features with Patch and Deploy including a front-end redesign, localization efforts, and support for new OS platforms. They remain some of the most widely used Tanium products.</p>
