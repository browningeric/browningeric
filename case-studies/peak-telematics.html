      <h2>The challenge</h2>
      <p>Peak Telematics wanted to help small insurance companies leverage usage-based insurance tools (like Progressive's Snapshot).</p>

      <h2>My role</h2>
      <p>Peak was working with an offshore back-end team for the application and physical logistics/fulfillment. My role was to take identity work another company had done and create the customer facing interface. I worked with multiple stakeholders to validate prototypes and design concepts. The final output was a working front end application that was integrated into the backend to create a working application.</p>

      <h2>Applying an existing brand to a new application</h2>
      <p>The Darby brand already had an identity, but I leveraged tools like element collages to quickly get feedback on overall style and tone.</p>

      <h2>What I learned</h2>
      <p>Working with a large team spread across multiple regions, languages, and timezones was challenging. There were times when I had to work in an inefficient way to better fit another team's requirements, and I always had to balance the volume of feedback with my own experience and the stated priorities.</p> 

      <p>Documentation was key every step of the way, and I created various diagrams and flow charts to keep everyone on the same page.</p>
