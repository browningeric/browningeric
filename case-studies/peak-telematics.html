      <h2>The challenge</h2>
      <p>Peak Telematics wanted to help small insurance companies leverage usage-based insurance tools (like Progressive's Snapshot). By offering a turnkey solution, customers could get lower rates and the insurance companies could stay competitive with the larger players in the space.</p>

      <h2>My role</h2>
      <p>Peak was working with an offshore back-end team for the application and physical logistics/fulfillment. My role was to take existing identity work and create the customer facing interface. I worked with multiple stakeholders to validate prototypes and design concepts. The final output was a working front end application that was integrated into the backend to create a working application.</p>
      <p>For non-standard UI pieces, I leveraged paper prototypes to quickly test ideas and explore layout options.</p>

      <h2>Applying an existing brand to a new application</h2>
      <p>The Darby brand already had an identity, but I used tools like element collages to quickly get feedback on overall style and tone. This worked really well to get non-designers to understand what the app could look like, without being bogged down on sample content or code. It was also easy to update and test changes.</p>

        <h2>Iteration and refinement</h2>
        <p>I built the components of the design system for the application through rounds of concepting and prototyping. When possible I used clickable prototypes so stakeholders could interact with the concepts on their own devices for a more realistic context vs static mockups.</p>

      <h2>What I learned</h2>
      <p>Working with a large team spread across multiple regions, languages, and timezones was challenging. There were times when I had to work in an inefficient way to better fit another team's requirements, and I always had to balance the volume of feedback with my own experience and the stated priorities.</p>

      <p>Documentation was key every step of the way, and I created various diagrams and flow charts to keep everyone on the same page.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>MVP product launched within original timeframe goals. The application worked well for a lengthy sales cycle, eventually being by acquired Azuga, who is currently representing it.</p>
