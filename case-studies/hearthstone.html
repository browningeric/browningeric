    <h2>The challenge</h2>
    <p>Combine the knowledge and processes Hearthstone Alzheimer Care had learned through their research with an easy to use interface for caregivers. The grant-funded app needed to offer specialized activities like games and quizzes, plus education for the caregivers and features for planning out their day.</p>

    <h2>My role</h2>
    <p>I managed the entire design process from meetings with stakeholders and subject matter experts, to creating a design system and front end for the application, to incorporating feedback from testing.</p>

    <h2>What I learned</h2>
    Building something for use by people with dementia was unique and challenging. While I'm familiar with WCAG guidelines, ARIA tags, and tools like contrast checking, I'm not an expert on working with people with dementia and alzheimers. Fortunately, the team from Hearthstone is and proved to be invaluable resources in guiding my design efforts.
