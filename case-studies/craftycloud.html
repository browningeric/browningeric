      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>Running craft fairs is challenging, and the process of managing vendor applications and approvals is one of the most time-consuming and cumbersome parts. I worked with a panel of organizers to plan and prototype a system that would make the process simple for them, and maybe even a little fun.</p>
      <h2 class="mini-section-header">Getting Started</h2>
      <p>I started the project focused on listening and understanding. I interviewed organizers to identify pain points and challenges. We then collaborated on sketching some user flows and feature ideas.</p>
      <p>I refined the sketches and incorporated some additional feedback to create a more polished version of this, which was valuable in discussions with remote team members; it's easier for some people to connect with a clean deliverable than trying to interpret sketches.</p>
      <h2>Design Iteration</h2>
      <p>For major components, I used a quick feedback loop approach. I tested various layout options with the team, then the best choices were tested in another round with different content, and a third round if necessary. This allowed quick progress but still considered different lengths and types of content.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Once we had enough of a product to test, we put it in front of craft fair organizers and vendors, and used surveys to learn more. Unfortunately, we found there wasn't a great market fit; peolpe loved the idea and the feature set, but the price point they could support (and the overall market size) didn't make sense to continue building and launching the app.</p>

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>Since the end product was an administrative interface to customize an API, there were many places a user could get overwhelmed by options. Unfortunately, these were necessary; I had to brainstorm ways to present forms and tables with a high information density while also finding places to add visual interest and branding.</p>
