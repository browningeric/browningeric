    <h1>MortgageCTO</h1>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>MortgageCTO wanted to leverage their expertise to create an API platform for providing more detailed loan quotes.</p>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>When I started the team had an idea of what they wanted to do, and some Excel based samples of calculations, rules, etc. </p>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    Working with a large team spread across multiple regions and languages was challenging. There were times when we had to work in an inefficient way to better fit another team's requirements, and we always had to balance the volume of feedback with my own experience and the stated priorities to work forn.
