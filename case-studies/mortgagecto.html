      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>MortgageCTO wanted to leverage their expertise to create an API platform for providing more detailed loan quotes.</p>
      <h2 class="mini-section-header">My Role</h2>
      <p>Working with a team of mortgage and financial software professionsals, I was tasked with bringing their ideas, sketches, and Excel prototypes to life. I spent time understanding the goals and challenging assumptions about user motivations, and use cases.</p>
      <p>I also prepared a research guide to help justify design decisions I was suggesting, and explain my process for the team. Combining reference materials with written explanations worked well.</p>

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>Since the end product was an administrative interface to customize an API, there were many places a user could get overwhelmed by options. Unfortunately, these were necessary; I had to brainstorm ways to present forms and tables with a high information density while also finding places to add visual interest and branding.</p>
