<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>Peak Telematics wanted to help small insurance companies leverage usage-based insurance tools (like Progressive's Snapshot).</p>

<h2>My Role</h2>
<p>Peak was working with an offshore back-end team for the application and physical logistics/fulfillment. My role was to take identity work another company had done and create the customer facing interface. I worked with multiple stakeholders to validate prototypes and design concepts. The final output was a working front end application that was integrated into the backend to create a working application.</p>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
Working with a large team spread across multiple regions and languages was challenging. There were times when we had to work in an inefficient way to better fit another team's requirements, and we always had to balance the volume of feedback with my own experience and the stated priorities to work forn.
